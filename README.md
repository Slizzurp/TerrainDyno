## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 Modular Architecture
- **Quark Suite**: Real-time capture, perception, context analysis, and prompt generation.
- **Pylon Suite**: (Coming soon) Fusion, semantic storage, export formatting, and orchestration.
- **SlizzAi ImageGen v2.0**: Emotionally tuned image generation engine with style fingerprinting and scene composition.

### 🎥 Real-Time Video Analysis
- Ingests live video frames and audio streams.
- Runs object detection, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.
- Generates human-readable descriptions and emotional sentiment.

### 🧠 Prompt Intelligence
- Converts environmental data into structured prompts.
- Suggests cinematic hooks and emotional overlays.
- Integrates user feedback to evolve style fingerprints.

### 🖼️ Image Generation
- Composes scenes based on prompt and emotional context.
- Selects optimal model configurations.
- Simulates high-resolution image rendering with metadata.

### 🖥️ GUI Interface
- PyQt5-based 3D viewer with rotation, scaling, and model loading.
- Trigger image generation directly from the interface.
- View and export generated assets.
