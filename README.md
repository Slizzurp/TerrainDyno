---

🔄 Sample Workflow

1. Define narrative context and emotion metadata.
2. Call `LayoutEngine.generate_layout(context)` to pick a base template.
3. Apply styling with `StyleOrchestrator.apply_style(template, theme="glitchcore")`.
4. Team enters a live session via `CollaborationHub.start_session()`.
5. Insert AI-generated copy with `ContentAI.generate_copy(prompt)`.
6. Export final design with `ExportPipeline.export(format="PDF", target="print")`.


---

🛠️ Integration Notes

• Tag templates with semantic attributes (emotion, genre, channel) for richer prompt inputs.
• Expose webhook endpoints so Pylon Suite can trigger layout or style updates on the fly.
• Swap in specialized LLMs in `ContentAI` for domain-specific narrative tone.
• Store assets in a shared vector DB (e.g., Azure Cosmos) for semantic consistency.
• Use PylonSuite’s orchestrator to coordinate versioned template updates and live previews.

• History tracking for iterative creativity

2. Emotionally Responsive Environments• Vector DB entries capturing emotional state and environmental cues
• Time-series retrieval to feed Mikky’s narrative arcs
• Persistent semantic storage for continuity

3. Cross-Tool Orchestration• Async/await workflows coordinate initialization and syncing
• Heartbeat-style pings maintain tool readiness
• Tools involved:• SlizzAi ImageGen v2.0 & v3.6

🛠️ Integration Notes

• Ensure each tool exposes an async `initialize()` method for orchestration.
• Replace placeholder embedding logic with production-grade vectorizers (e.g., OpenAI embeddings).
• Extend `ExportFormatter` mappings to support project-specific channels.
• Use persistent storage (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB) instead of in-memory lists for production.
